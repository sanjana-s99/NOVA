# Iot Based Smart Plant Monitoring Pot

People living in the world today are busy. Essential work for them because of their work. We are often overlooked. Today, as well as today, the whole world is in danger of extinction due to our environment's deforestation. Accordingly, the amount of Oxygen we inhalation is decreasing day by day. And because of man's busy schedule, he has no time to care for even the smallest flowering plant in his home. So we decided to create a smart pot as a solution for this. We hope that we will be able to maintain these small plants in the house properly.
